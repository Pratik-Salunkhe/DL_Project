## PROBLEM STATEMENT :
  In hilly areas with curvy roads, going around sharp turns is a big safety challenge because these turns block the view, making it hard to see, and that raises the chance of accidents.

  ### Importance of Addressing Blind Corner Collisions

Timely intervention  (Acting quickly)  is really important to reduce the higher chance of accidents at spots where you can't see well around corners. This highlights the importance of creative solutions to make roads safer in hilly areas.

## OBJECTIVE :
  Our project aims to uses a CNN-based system to identify  the vehicles on the road, to prevent the collisions by classifying and alerting drivers about vehicles on-road in blind corners, thereby enhancing safety in challenging areas where we canâ€™t see the vehicle ahead.
